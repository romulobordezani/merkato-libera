# Meli FE test

This repository contains the `Front End Test for Meli`, made by Romulo Bordezani, with a lot of love and hope to one day join Meli's team üòç.

### On Production
I left a *Progressive Web App* available at: [meli-front-end-test.herokuapp.com](https://meli-front-end-test.herokuapp.com/).

### Free Hosting
NOTE: It's a heroku free app, so, it sleeps when idle. 
As expected, the very first load could take between 10 or 30 sec, while the Docker Whale awakes üê≥

### What is done
I was able to finish the main issues in the challenge, but I found something else to do that deserves attention.
Please take a look at the [TODO Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/d/n7bvXIbrRFCRwDLh3RW5y2np) related to this project, if you have a chance. 
There you can find what is missing and what is accomplished.
